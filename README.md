This is a Basic game named "NUMBER GUESSING". As the name suggests , we will have to guess the number that the compiler generated which is between 1 to 100. This is very User Friendly Game.Let me explain this in detail.

Header Inclusions: The code begins with including necessary header files. iostream for input and output operations, cstdlib for the rand() and srand() functions, and ctime for the time() function. Namespace Usage: using namespace std; is a directive that tells the compiler to consider all the entities in the std namespace as if they were declared in the global namespace. This is done to avoid having to prepend std:: to every standard library function or object.
Main Function: The program's execution starts from the main() function. Random Seed Initialization: srand(time(0)); initializes the random number generator with the current time as the seed. This ensures that the sequence of random numbers generated by rand() will be different each time the program runs.
Variable Declarations: num - Holds the randomly generated secret number, temp - Stores the user's guessed number, chances - Represents the number of chances the player has to guess the number based on the selected difficulty level, lvl - Represents the selected difficulty level, over - Variable that decides to display the successful or try again message. 
Difficulty Selection: The user is prompted to choose the level of difficulty by entering a number. Based on the input, the number of chances is set accordingly. Random Number Generation: rand() % 100 generates a random number between 1 and 100 and assigns it to the variable chance.
Game Loop: A for loop iterates from 1 to the chosen number of chances. During each iteration, the user is prompted to input their guess.
Guess Comparison: If the guess matches the secret number, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the loop breaks. If the guess is lower than the secret number, the user is prompted to try a higher number. If the guess is higher than the secret number, the user is prompted to try a lower number.During every Guess , the Number of chances is reduced and it will be shown to the user each time after entering the guess number. 
End of Game: After the loop ends ,a message will be shown to asks whether the user want to play again. It will be achieved by using do while loop.Return Statement: The main() function returns 0, indicating successful execution.
